## Kaggle Challenge - Kernel Methods for Machine Learning

To generate the final submission file, please  execute the following : 
`python main.py 
`

This command will generate a csv file named 'final_submission.csv'. The predictions contained in this file give a 67.33% public score and a 67.53% private score. 
It will also create feature matrices for the training datasets and store them in folder 'mismatch_matrices' for easier future use. 

The first execution of main.py (which creates the feature matrices) should take no more than 4 minutes. Following executions will only take 1min 30s. 

If you have trouble with importations : `pip intall requirements.txt`
